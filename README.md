## About
Our final project is an attempt to recreate the populat Jackbox game 'Guesspionage', but tailored towards Wellesley College students. This project was created with software such as MongoDB and Node.js.

## Features
Our project allows the user to:
- log-in and log-out (thus essentially creating an account)
- answer a couple of preliminary questions prior to playing the game
- play the actual guessing game, and then see how far off they were from the correct answers
- see their final score and the current leaderboard
- insert their own questions to the questions database


## Acknoledgements
We would like to give credit for the idea of Guesspionage to the respective owner, Jackbox Games.

## License
We don't have a license (or well, not any that we are aware of). We are just here to live love laugh (also we thought that we should have this section because every README.md seems to have one...).
